<h2>Dragon Burner compatible carriages for the Double Dragon</h2>
These carriages are a modified version of cariage from chirpy2605.

<h3>Left, Right, Rigth_SWLeft and Left_SWRight?</h3>
I made an extra set off carriages where the endstop is on the other side. Now you can switch the upper and lower belt from side. Some like it that way.
You also can home all to the left or all to the right. Al options are open now.
