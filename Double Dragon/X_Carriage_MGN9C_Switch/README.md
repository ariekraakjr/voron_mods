<h2>Dragon Burner compatible carriages for the Double Dragon</h2>
These carriages are a modified version of cariage from chirpy2605.

<h3>Left, right and left_swright?</h3>
I made an extra leftside carriage where the endstop switch is on the right. Now you can home your left toolhead against the right toolhead for better resolution. (if you can figure it out in config)
